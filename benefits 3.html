<h1 align =center>Cardiovascular Disease</h1>
<p>Heart disease and stroke are two leading causes of death in the United States. Getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases. You can reduce your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular physical activity can also lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.</p>
<h1 align =center>Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome</h1>
<p>Regular physical activity can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is some combination of too much fat around the waist, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high blood sugar. People start to see benefits at levels from physical activity even without meeting the recommendations for 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity. Additional amounts of physical activity seem to lower risk even more.</p>

<p>Being physically active lowers your risk for developing several common cancers.  Adults who participate in greater amounts of physical activity have reduced risks of developing cancers of the:</p>
<i>☛ Bladder</i>
<i>☛ Breast</i>
<i>☛ Colon (proximal and distal)</i>
<i>☛ Endometrium</i>
<i>☛ Esophagus (adenocarcinoma)</i>
<i>☛ Kidney</i>
<i>☛ Lung</i>
