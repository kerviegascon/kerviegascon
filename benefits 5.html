<p>Everyday activities include climbing stairs, grocery shopping, or playing with your grandchildren. Being unable to do everyday activities is called a functional limitation. Physically active middle-aged or older adults have a lower risk of functional limitations than people who are inactive.</p>
<p>For older adults, doing a variety of physical activity improves physical function and decreases the risk of falls or injury from a fall. Include physical activities such as aerobic, muscle strengthening, and balance training. Multicomponent physical activity can be done at home or in a community setting as part of a structured program.</p>
<p>Hip fracture is a serious health condition that can result from a fall. Breaking a hip have life-changing negative effects, especially if youâ€™re an older adult. Physically active people have a lower risk of hip fracture than inactive people.</p>
