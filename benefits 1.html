<p>Both eating patterns and physical activity routines play a critical role in weight management. You gain weight when you consume more calories through eating and drinking than the amount of calories you burn, including those burned during physical activity.</p>
<p>To maintain your weight: Work your way up to 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity, which could include dancing or yard work. You could achieve the goal of 150 minutes a week with 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.</p>
<p>People vary greatly in how much physical activity they need for weight management. You may need to be more active than others to reach or maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<p>To lose weight and keep it off: You will need a high amount of physical activity unless you also adjust your eating patterns and reduce the amount of calories youâ€™re eating and drinking. Getting to and staying at a healthy weight requires both regular physical activity and healthy eating.</p>
